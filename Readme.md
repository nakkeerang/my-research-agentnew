# 📚 Gemini Research Agent

## 🔍 Overview

This is an AI-powered research assistant built with **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**, designed to help users generate research  on various topics and break down a research topic into subtopics and generate concise summaries. The application offers an interactive **Streamlit** UI, allowing users to approve or revise AI-generated content and download the summarised report.

---

## 📘 Scenario

Imagine a student, educator, or researcher who needs to quickly understand a complex topic. Instead of manually browsing multiple sources, this app allows the user to:

* Generate research article on any topic
* Decompose a topic into logical subtopics,
* Generate summaries for each one,
* Review and edit content before accepting


The tool streamlines the entire process, enabling fast and accurate content generation with human feedback in the loop.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Build an intelligent research assistant that:

* Accepts a broad topic from the user,
* Uses Gemini to generate 3–5 key subtopics,
* Summarizes each subtopic in \~100 words,
* Allows human-in-the-loop editing of summaries,
* Exports a structured research report,
* Runs seamlessly in a Streamlit interface.
